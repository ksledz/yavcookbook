======================

Inspired by: `One Pot Creamy Sun-Dried Tomato & Chicken Thigh Stew <https://www.gousto.co.uk/cookbook/recipes/one-pot-creamy-sun-dried-tomato-chicken-stew>`_ and the TikTok `Marry Me Chicken <https://littlesunnykitchen.com/marry-me-chicken/>`_

at least 4 servings

Ingredients
-----------

* 2 turkey tenderloins - 400g
* olive oil (optionally if you need to add more than sundried tomato oil)
* 1 shallot onion, chopped
* 2 garlic cloves
* 45 g of sundried tomatoes, chopped + oil from the jar
* splash of tomato passata
* 4-5 cherry tomatoes
* 1/2 bouillon cube
* 2 tablespoons 18% sour cream
* 45g of grated Italian hard cheese 
* 500g of small gnocchi
* salt and pepper

Preparation
-----------

#. Cut meat into bite-sized pieces and eason meat w salt and pepper
#. Heat a big pan with sundried tomato oil on medium heat, fry garlic and onions until translucent
#. Add meat and sear for 3-5 mins or until no longer pink on any side
#. Add all forms of tomato, bouillon cube, water and stir (maybe blend everything besides meat for smooth consistency if you care but idc)
#. Simmer in sauce for at least 7-8 minutes (or shorter if the pieces are small, if the breasts are whole, turn once or twice). Check meat doneness by taking the biggest piece and cutting into it to see if it's still pink on the inside (or with a meat thermometer if you have one)
#. Stir in the cream and cheese making sure it doesn't clump, add gnocchi and enough water to submmerge them in water, simmer 2 minutes (or gnocchi cooking time on the pack), serve warm.

Makes/Notes
-----------

#. Made one on 19 January 2025, probably could do with less sour cream to balance the acidity and intensity of the cream flavor
#. The protein and starch are easily swappable, easily made vegetarian, if you're interested in a vegan version, probably follow along `those directions <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPEYMkH8lm4>`_
