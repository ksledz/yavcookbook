Tortilla de patatas (fritas)
============================

Original recipe: `Food Gal  <https://www.foodgal.com/2022/03/when-life-gives-you-leftover-french-fries/>`_

4 servings. It's a nice way to use leftover fries

Ingredients
-----------

* 2 tablespoons olive or vegetable oil, more as needed (adjust for the fries oil level)
* 1 serving of leftover fast food fries (preferably thicker ones, like KFC), one recipe suggests cutting them into shorter chunks
* 4 eggs
* salt (adjust for the fries salinity)
* black pepper
* like half an onion, cut into feathers

Preparation
-----------

#. Heat a small pan (I used one TODO diameter) over medium heat, add oil, fries, and onion, fry for 3-4 minutes.
#. crack the eggs into a bowl, add salt and pepper and mix well, otherwise some servings will be over- and some under-salted.
#. Reduce the heat to low and pour in the egg mix. You can rotate the pan to encourage even cooking. 
#. After a few minutes (OG recipe says 8, i think mine was shorter due to size), when sides are cooked, but the middle isn't, rotate the tortilla using a spatula.
#. After roughly the same amount of time or when you check its cooked through, take it off the pan, and cut into 8 slices. It's very good eaten cold from the fridge the next day.

Makes/Notes
-----------

#. 6th July make, undermixed batter, the tortilla was a bit too thin to my taste with TODO diameter and 4 eggs.
#. May try with more eggs per cm of radius.
#. May test `Kimchi and beans <https://web.archive.org/web/20200605042255/http://www.kimchiandbeans.com/2020/05/day-old-french-fry-spanish-tortilla.html>`_ fries to egg ratio.
