========

Original recipe: `Agnieszka KrÄ™glicka (PL) <https://web.archive.org/web/20080502173425/http://ugotuj.to/przepisy_kulinarne/1,88736,1572627,Tiramisu.html>`_

36cm x 25cm pan

Ingredients
-----------

* 1kg mascarpone
* 8-10 egg yolks
* 200g icing sugar
* 150ml amaretto
* 400g ladyfingers/savoiardi
* 800g strong cooled coffee (my sister recommends lighter flowery/fruity coffees and "alternative brewing methods")

Preparation
-----------

#. Beat the yolks with the icing sugar until very smooth.
#. Gradually add the mascarpone, beating until the cream thickens.
#. Combine the coffee with the amaretto and pour into a bowl.
#. Briefly soak half of the ladyfingers in the coffee, so that they soak but do not fall apart.
#. Place them on the bottom of the pan, sprinkle lightly with cocoa, then spread half of the cream, sprinkle lightly with cocoa, another layer of soaked ladyfingers, cocoa and the second half of the cream.
#. You can serve immediately, but it is better to put it in the fridge for at least two hours.
#. Sprinkle cocoa on top before serving.

Makes/Notes
-----------

#. My mom made it countless times, my sister did it with half kilo mascarpone, 3 yolks and 50g icing sugar for a very dense cream.
#. Yes it uses raw egg yolks, gotta test scalding the shells for safety.
