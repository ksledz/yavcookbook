Burnt Basque Cheesecake
=======================

Original recipe: `Diario Vasco (ES lang) <https://www.diariovasco.com/gastronomia/recetas/postres/receta-tarta-queso-20201105113026-nt.html>`_

24x34cm pan, OG for 25cm diameter round pan, so I multiplied proportions by 1.5

Ingredients
-----------

* 600 g sugar
* 10 eggs 
* 1,5kg philadelphia-style cream cheese
* 750g cream 36% fat (used 800g bc 200g packaging)
* 5 teaspoons/1.5 tablespoon flour

Preparation
-----------

#. Preheat the oven to 200C
#. Mix everything together with a mixer (used immersion blender)
#. Line the baking pan with parchment paper, pour in the batter
#. Bake at least 45 minutes, the top has to brown unevenly and crackle, adjust for texture (45mins gave me a cheesecake with texture approaching polish cheesecake on the sides, approaching NY cheesecake in the middle)
#. Rest for a few minutes, then get it out of the pan delicately. Some recipes recommend resting 2-3 hours, but you can eat faster, it will taste a bit like a freshly baked polish cheesecake. After resting in the freezer it will taste like a cross between polish cheesecake (chilled) and NY cheesecake, but it does depend on the cut.

Makes/Notes
-----------

#. Made one 30 Nov 2024 with friends, they really liked the fresh-outta oven taste and the way it ends up soaked in caramel, kind of like creme caramel. This recipe taught me a lot about what i call "the polish cheesecake to NY cheesecake spectrum" and makes me want to experiment with mixing particular traits of particular kinds of cheesecakes.
