===================================

Original recipe: `Kuchnia TV (PL) <https://www.canalpluskuchnia.pl/przepisy/gorzkie-ciasto-czekoladowe>`_

1 round cake pan, 25cm diameter


Ingredients
-----------

* 300g bitter chocolate (at least 50% cocoa)
* 225g butter
* 7-8 eggs, divided into  whites and yolks
* 170g sugar
* 2.25 teaspoons cocoa

Preparation
-----------

#. Preheat the convection oven to 180C.
#. Chop the chocolate and the butter, place in a bowl and melt in a bain mairie. Mix delicately, and then remove the bowl from the steam.
#. Whip the egg whites until soft peaks.
#. Whip the egg yolks with sugar.
#. Mix the yolks and chocolate, add sieved-through cocoa.
#. Whip the egg whites a bit more, add a large spoonful of the whipped egg whites to the chocolate, mix, “loosening” the chocolate. Add the rest of the egg whites in three partsand combine gently, stirring from the bottom, so that the mass is aerated and does not lose its fluffiness.
#. Pour the mass into the (springform) cake pan.
#. Bake for 35 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the cake is "almost clean".

Serve after cooling.
