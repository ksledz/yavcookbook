Original recipe: `Spain on a Fork  <https://spainonafork.com/spanish-creamy-rice-with-vegetables-recipe/>`_

2 voluminous servings if it's main dish, more if it's treated as a side dish. 

Vegan, good way to eat a lot of veggies while having sensory issues.

Ingredients
-----------

* 2.5 tablespoons olive or vegetable oil.
* like half an onion, cut into feathers
* 4 cloves garlic
* 1 carrot
* 1 bell pepper (recommended 1/2 green and 1/2 red, can be monochromatic)
* 400 grams (before draining) canned or jarred chickpea
* 220 grams (1 cup) paella (or risotto) rice
* 1 liter vegetable broth (i use water with 2 bouillon cubes)
* 1 teaspoon sweet smoked (Spanish) paprika
* salt
* pepper
* OG recipe adds 1/4 teaspoon saffron threads and parsley

Preparation
-----------

#. Roughly chop the onion, garlic, pepper and carrot (if you happen to have thermomix or a copycat its good for it). Drain and rinse chickpeas.
#. Heat a large pan and add oil, add onion, carrot and pepper and sautee for 5-6 minutes. Again, you can do it in a thermomix (pls dont bully me its my parents who got this upper middle class status symbol "smart" pot)
#. If you fry in a pan, remove the veggies, add 1/2tbsp oil, garlic and rice and fry it for like 2 minutes like you do for risotto. In my thermomix mode, i just left the veggies inside the thermomix and fried the rice on a pan.
#. blend the vegetables with 1/4 cup of chickpeas and some (1/3 cup) of your broth. Yes, thermomix is really good for that.
#. In your final cooking vessel, mix broth, rice, seasonings and vegetable puree, bring to a boil and cook for 12 minutes, stirring every minute just like risotto. Yes, thermomix is really good for cooking while keeping things stirring.
#. After 12 minutes theres a lot of broth left. Turn off the heat, put the lid on, and wait 5-10 minutes until rice absorbs enough broth to your liking. Serve and enjoy.

Makes/Notes
-----------

#. Made one 12 July 2024 with the status symbol "smart" pot, adding some cashews bc they were a leftover. Made it several times in the past with regular pan and a blender. No comments, it's always very good. May try more Spain on a Fork recipes for vegetablemaxxing.
