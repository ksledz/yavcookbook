* 1/2 line - juice and zest

Preparation
-----------

#. Season meat w salt and pepper
#. Heat a big pan with oil on medium heat, and sear the meat for 3-5 mins or until no longer pink on any side

#. Add all the other ingredients besides chicken and cream, stir (maybe blend for smooth consistency if you care)
#. Add the meat back to the pan, simmer in sauce for 7-8 minutes (or shorter if the pieces are small, if the breasts are whole, turn once or twice).
