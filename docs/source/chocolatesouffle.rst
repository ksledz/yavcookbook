Chocolate souffle
=========================

Original recipe: `Kulinarna Mekka (PL) <http://kulinarnamekka.com/idealny-suflet-czekoladowy/>`_

4/6 portions


Ingredients
-----------

* 140g/210g bitter chocolate (at least 50% cocoa)
* 30g/45g softened butter + some to butter the ramekins
* 4/6 egg whites that weigh 140g/210g (weight is important)
* 40g/60g sugar
* a pinch of salt
* optional 4/6 pinches chilli

Preparation
-----------

#. Preheat the convection oven to 180C
#. Grease the ramekins with butter and place in the refrigerator.
#. Chop the chocolate into cubes, place in a bowl and melt in a bain mairie. Add butter and optional chili to the melted chocolate, mix well, and then remove the bowl from the steam. Cool the chocolate slightly while stirring.
#. Whip the egg whites until stiff, adding a pinch of salt. Add a spoonful of sugar to the whipped egg whites, still beating.
#. Add a large spoonful of the whipped egg whites to the chocolate, mix, “loosening” the chocolate. Add the rest of the egg whites and combine gently, stirring from the bottom, so that the mass is aerated and does not lose its fluffiness.
#. Pour the mass into the cooled ramekins (do not sprinkle them with flour!), level. If the edges of the ramekin get dirty while applying the mixture, clean them thoroughly so that the soufflés can rise without any problems.
#. Bake for 8-9 minutes if you want the centre of the soufflé to be liquid, or for 11-12 minutes if you want it to be more cooked.
Serve immediately, sprinkled with icing sugar or cocoa.
