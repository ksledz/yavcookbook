10-12 muffins

Ingredients
-----------

WET INGREDIENTS:

* 1/2 cup brown sugar
* 1 egg
* 50ml oil
* 1/2 cup buttermilk (or kefir)
* 1/2 cup milk
* 1/2 cup honey
* 1 splash of vanilla extract (less than 1 teaspoon)
* 70g butter, melted (I replaced less than half of the butter with olive oil but it was still good))

DRY INGREDIENTS:

* 1,5 cup wheat flour
* 0,5 cup whole wheat flour
* 1 teaspoon of baking soda
* 1 teaspoon of baking powder
* a pinch of salt
* 1 tablespoon of gingerbread seasoning

ADDITIONALLY:

* 100g chopped milk or bitter chocolate

Preparation
-----------

#. Preheat the oven to 190C
#. Its muffins, combine all the wet ingredients (yes sugar counts as wet ingredient in the standard muffin procedure) together
#. Add all the dry ingredients, and mix until it roughly comes together, don't overmix, some clumps are fine
#. Fold in the aple and chocolate
#. Line the muffin pan with papilottes or just try to stick squares of baking paper inside, maybe with some strategic cuts to them, Plop the batter into lined muffin pan, fill the holes 3/4.
#. Bake 25 minutes or until skewers come out of the muffin clean (not wet with batter) or "Check for doneness by pressing down on the top of the muffin. If it bounces back, it's done."
#. Let the muffins rest and cool after you take them off the oven, maybe decorate with chocolate glaze/ganache/etc

Makes/Notes
-----------

#. Google doc is from 21-12-2015, must have made it around that time
#. For some reason the OG recipe counts sugar as a dry ingredient in the muffin process.
