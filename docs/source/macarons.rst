Recipe for "regular meringue" macarons, as opposed to eg. Italian meringues
??? portions

Ingredients
-----------

COOKIES

* 70g egg whites, dried for 12-24hrs, prepare at least 80g so its 70 after drying
* 35g and 135g icing sugar
* 100g almond flour, sifted through
* 2 teaspoons instant coffee/1.5 teaspoon powdered coloring (one time i tried matcha but it flopped)

EXAMPLE TIRAMISU FILLING

* 150g mascarpone
* 2 tablespoons espresso
* 1 teaspoon icing sugar
* 1 tablespoon amaretto
* 1 tablespoon cocoa

Preparation
-----------

#. Whip egg whites till stiff peaks, add 35g sugar, whip with a mixer for MAX 3 MINUTES.
#. Sift 135g sugar, almond flour, and coloring agent. Fold it gently into the egg whites
#. Put the batter into a piping bag (put over a glass), pipe equal sized circles on a baking sheet lined with parchment.
#. Delicately, but firmly tap the sheet over the edge of a couch/bed, so the batter spreads evenly without peaks.
#. Rest the sheet for 30mins, so a thin dry film appears on the macarons. Test it by touch.
#. Bake 140C 12-15 minutes, so the cookies dont brown, dont open the oven during the baking process. 
#. Rest the cookies for 10mins, before releasing them from the parchment.

Makes/Notes
-----------

#. Made them a few times in 2015ish, the matcha version flopped, the coffee/tiramisu was nice. I wonde how well I'd fare making them now as an adult and not a clumsy, baking beginner teen.
