Poulet basquaise
================

Original recipe: Sarah Woodward book The Food of France

??? servings, I think it was enough for several people


Ingredients
-----------

* 2 chicken breasts (book asks for 4 thighs and drumsticks)
* salt and pepper
* 3 tablespoons olive oil
* 1 long red pepper, cut into strips (4 green)
* 1 (large Spanish) onion, sliced into half-moons
* 2 slices of cured ham, cut into strips
* 2 cloves of garlic, peeled and crushed
* optional 1 cup white wine
* 200 ml tomato puree
* 200 ml water
* 1 teaspoon red pepper
* optional 1 crushed chilli and 1 tablespoon parsley

Preparation
-----------

#. If you want a nontraditional stew, then cut the meat into large chunks (the recipe does not require this) and SEASON THEM PROPERLY (this can be difficult). 
#. Heat the olive oil (in a heavy saucepan, I did it in a pot), fry the meat for about 5 minutes until browned, then remove it.
#. Replace the meat in the pot with paprika and onion. Fry for 10 minutes on low heat, stirring, add the ham and garlic and fry for another 10 minutes. 
#. Pour in (wine) puree and water (and pour into the pan), add paprika (and chilli), bring to the boil, add the chicken. 
#. Cook for 25-30 minutes uncovered. (Sprinkle with parsley before serving)
