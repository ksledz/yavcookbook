=============

Original recipe (PL): `Kraina Smak√≥w Blogspot <http://kraina-smakow.blogspot.com/2013/08/muffiny-z-musli.html>`_

6 chunky muffins

Good way to deal with leftover musli/granola (maybe some cereal, brans, oats etc) that you don't want to eat miserably or throw away. Feel free to pick raisins out of the musli mix before using it like a Cinderella without the little helpers.

Ingredients
-----------

WET INGREDIENTS:

* 1/2 cup (circa 200g) sugar (OG calls for 3/4 cup of brown sugar)
* 1 egg
* 1/2 cup (circa 112.5g) neutral oil (I use rapeseed/canola oil)
* 1 cup of milk
* 1 tablespoon vanilla sugar

DRY INGREDIENTS:

* 2 cups (circa 296.5g) flour (i used cake flour)
* 1 cup of musli/granola  
* 2 teaspoons of baking powder
* a pinch of salt

Preparation
-----------

#. Preheat the oven to 190C
#. Its muffins, combine all the wet ingredients (yes sugar counts as wet ingredient in the standard muffin procedure) together
#. Add all the dry ingredients, and mix until it roughly comes together, don't overmix, some clumps are fine
#. You can fold in some extra chunky stuff like nuts or chocolate or whatever
#. Line the muffin pan with papilottes or just try to stick squares of baking paper inside, maybe with some strategic cuts to them, plop the batter into lined muffin pan.
#. Bake 25 minutes or until skewers come out of the muffin clean (not wet with batter) or "Check for doneness by pressing down on the top of the muffin. If it bounces back, it's done."
#. Let the muffins rest and cool after you take them off the oven.

Makes/Notes
-----------

#. Made several batches in the last 9-ish years or so, last one 18 August 2024, its always good
