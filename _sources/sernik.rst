Makes/Notes
-----------

#. My grandma made it countless times, the notes i have in my google doc have same ingredients separated into different portions, i'm not sure if i correctly described it how much of what goes into which part (I definitely dont know where the pudding mix goes), but that's the joy of your grandmas recipes written not-precisely in an old notebook :)
