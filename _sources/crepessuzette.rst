Crepes Suzette
=========================

Original recipe: `Kwestia smaku (PL) <http://www.kwestiasmaku.com/kuchnia_francuska/crepes_suzette/przepis.html>`_

2 portions

Ingredients
-----------
* 4 crepes
* 3 tablespoons sugar
* juice from 1/4 lemon
* zest from 1 orange
* juice from 1-2 oranges, at least 1/2 cup
* 3 tablespoons butter
* 1 tablespoon orange liqueur
* 3 tablespoons brandy for flambeeing

Preparation
-----------
#. Heat a 20cm diameter pan over medium heat, pour sugar into the middle and sprinkle with lemon juice. Keep the pan over medium heat without stirring for about 2 minutes - during this time the sugar will start to bubble, creating a thick syrup, which will eventually start to brown.

#. When the syrup is brown (be careful not to burn the sugar, because it will be bitter and the whole sauce will fail), add the zest and orange juice and mix quickly. Add the butter and mix continuously  until the syrup is smooth (there may be lumps, which will disappear as you heat the sauce while stirring). Pour in the orange liqueur and mix.

#. With the pan with the syrup still on the burner, put one pancake in and dip it in the sauce, fold it into a quarter and move it to the side of the pan, put in the second pancake and repeat as before. Prepare the rest of the pancakes, then pour in the brandy and immediately set on fire (be careful, do not lean your head over the pan!). The sauce must be boiling for the alcohol to ignite. Place on a plate.

Makes/Notes
-----------

#. Serve with whipped cream or 2 tablespoons of mascarpone cheese + 2 teaspoons of sugar + 50 ml of 30% cream (whipped together).
