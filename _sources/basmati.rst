Indian Restaurant-like Basmati
==============================

Original recipe: `Spiceupthecurry <https://www.spiceupthecurry.com/basmati-rice-recipe/>`_

4 servings, apparently I used half of that for myself

Vegetarian, idk what would be a vegan replacement for ghee.

Ingredients
-----------

* 1 cup/240ml Basmati rice
* 3 teaspoons Ghee (clarified butter)
* 1 teaspoon Lemon juice
* 2 cups/480ml Water
* Salt to taste

Preparation
-----------

#. Wash basmati rice under running cold water until water runs clear.
#. Soak rice in enough water for at least 10-15 minutes.
#. After 15 minutes drain the rice and let it dry in colander or strainer for 10 minutes. This step helps to firm up the rice.
#. Heat the ghee in a thick bottom saucepan on medium heat.
#. Once hot add rice and sauté them for a minute.
#. Add 2 cups of water, salt, and lemon juice. mix well.
#. Let the water come up to a boil.
#. Then cover it. And reduce the heat to the lowest possible heat.
#. Simmer it for 17-18 minutes. And turn off the heat.
#. Let it stand for 10 minutes covered. This step is a must. So rice gets time to firm up and so the rice won’t break while you stir. Then open the lid.
#. Fluff up the rice using a fork.

Makes/Notes
-----------

#. Always use cold water to wash the rice.
#. Use warm or room temperature water to soak the rice.
#. Always use a deep saucepan, not shallow pan.
