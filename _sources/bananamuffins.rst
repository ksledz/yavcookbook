Banana muffins
==================

Original recipe: `Simply Recipes <https://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/banana_nut_muffins/>`_

6 chunky muffins

Good way to deal with leftover bananas and make them taste not overwhelmingly banana-y.

Ingredients
-----------

WET INGREDIENTS:

* 2-3 ripe bananas, mashed
* 100g sugar
* 1 egg
* 1 pinch instant coffee + a tablespoon/splash of water
* 1 splash of vanilla extract (less than 1 teaspoon)
* 70g butter, melted (I replaced less than half of the butter with olive oil but it was still good))

DRY INGREDIENTS:

* 200g flour (i used cake flour)
* 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda
* a pinch of salt

ADDITIONALLY:

* OG recipe adds 1 cup chopped nuts

Preparation
-----------

#. Preheat the oven to 180C (350F)
#. Its muffins, combine all the wet ingredients (yes sugar counts as wet ingredient in the standard muffin procedure) together (you can combine them while blending it all if you haven't mashed banana yet)
#. Add all the dry ingredients, and mix until it roughly comes together, don't overmix, some clumps are fine
#. You can fold in some extra chunky stuff like nuts or chocolate or whatever
#. Line the muffin pan with papilottes or just try to stick squares of baking paper inside, maybe with some strategic cuts to them, Plop the batter into lined muffin pan.
#. Bake 20-25 minutes or until skewers come out of the muffin clean (not wet with batter) or "Check for doneness by pressing down on the top of the muffin. If it bounces back, it's done."
#. Let the muffins rest and cool after you take them off the oven.

Makes/Notes
-----------

#. Made a batch 24 July 2024 and holy shit those are so good (I find raw banana overwhelming but the muffins had mild aroma that didn't overwhelm me personally). Shared them with several friends and family members who all liked it.
#. Made two batches 10 Nov 2024 from 6 bananas, using plant fats (olive oil+canola oil) only, replacing 2 eggs with 3-4 egg whites and using mostly whole wheat flour. Good, but a bit too much for 12 muffin forms.
