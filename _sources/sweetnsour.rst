===================

Original source: `Hot Thai Kitchen <https://hot-thai-kitchen.com/sweet-and-sour-pork/>`_

Supposedly 4 servings, when I replaced half of the pork with button mushrooms it made 2 big servings.

Ingredients
-----------

* 340g pork tenderloin/shoulder/chops (I used 170g/2 pork chops and added mushrooms. Can be subbed with chicken or tofu)
* 10 ml/2 teaspoons soy sauce
* 30ml/2 tablespoons neutral oil
* 5 cloves of chopped garlic
* 100g (1 half) onion, cut in strips
* 150g cucumber slices (i replaced it with mushrooms)
* 150g fresh pineapple, chunks (i replaced it with 150g pineapple juice)
* 100g bell pepper (i used red), julienned
* 70g cashews
* rice for serving
* 22g/2 tablespoons brown sugar
* 30ml mirin
* 30ml oyster sauce
* 30ml sriracha/ketchup
* 15ml soy sauce
* 10ml toasted sesame oil
Preparation
-----------
#. Remove white sinew/silver skin/connective tissue from the pork and cut it into 8mm thick, "bite sized" bits. Put it into a bowl, add soy sauce and mix, let it marinate.
#. Make the sauce by mixing all ingredients until sugar is mostly dissolved.
#. Heat a wok/skillet/pan with oil, when it's hot, put the pork chunks in one layer (not overcrowding the pot), sear on one side for 1-2 minutes until that side is browned.
#. Start stirring (stir-fry) for about 30 seconds, until most of the exterior is cooked, remove from pan, leaving fond behind.
#. In the same pan on medium heat, add a little bit more oil if needed, then saute the garlic and onion until the garlic starts to turn golden.
#. Turn the heat to high, add the vegetables, fruit (juice) and the sauce.
#. Stir fry for about 2 minutes or until your preferred vegetable done-ness.
#. Add pork back, continue stir frying for 30 seconds or until the sauce reduces to your liking (can take time if you add the juice).
#. Turn off the heat and add (can be A LITTLE BIT crushed for optimal texture experience) cashews.
#. Serve with rice.

Makes/Notes
-----------

#. Made one 7th July 2024 with modifications described above. Next time i will keep the OG ratio of protein without swapping it for stuff like mushrooms.
